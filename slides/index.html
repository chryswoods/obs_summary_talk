    ## OpenBioSim
    ### Bringing interoperability and interactivity to open source molecular design
    Christopher Woods

    Head of Research Software Engineering

    University of Bristol
    ---
    ## OpenBioSim

    * https://openbiosim.org
    * Community Interest Company
    * Develop and support Open Source software for drug design
    * Help glue together all the amazing tools developed by the community
    ---
    ## Key software

    * sire
      * https://sire.openbiosim.org
      * interoperability for molecular information
    * BioSimSpace
      * https://biosimspace.openbiosim.org
      * interoperability between simulation packages
    ---
    ## Part 1 - sire
    ---
    ![sire hero shot](images/hero_shot.png) <!-- .element height="60%" width="60%" -->
    
    Quick demo - what can it do?
    ---
    ## Information engine

    * sire is a molecular information engine
    * Containers store arbitrary molecular information
    * In-built search engine retrieves that data
    * All based on the concept of molecular property dictionaries
      and molecular views
    * Another demo!
    ---
    ## Installation and tutorials

    * Distributed via conda
      * `conda create -n openbiosim`
      * `conda activate openbiosim`
      * `conda install -c openbiosim sire`
    * Also available freely online
      * https://try.openbiosim.org
    * Tutorials, quick start and detailed guides 
      available at https://sire.openbiosim.org
    ---
    ## Part 2: BioSimSpace
    ---
     ![BioSimSpace wordcloud](images/wordcloud.png) <!-- .element height="60%" width="60%" -->
    ---
     ![BioSimSpace MD](images/bss_md.png) <!-- .element height="60%" width="60%" -->

    Quick demo - what can it do?
    ---
    ## Robust components

    * BioSimSpace lets us separate the creation of simulation protocols
      from the details of running the individual software packages that
      perform the work of those protocols
    * Results in robust and reusable components that can be joined 
      together into complete workflows
    * BioSimSpace has protocols for different types of simulations,
      including their setup and subsequent analysis
    ---
     ![BioSimSpace Free Energy](images/bss_freenrg.png) <!-- .element height="60%" width="60%" -->
    
    Quick demo - free energy calculations
    ---
    ## BioSimSpace

    * Other types of simulations are supported
      * Absolute binding free energies
      * Metadynamics / funnel metadynamics
      * Steered MD
    ---
    ## Installation and Tutorials

    * Distributed via conda
      * `conda create -n openbiosim`
      * `conda activate openbiosim`
      * `conda install -c openbiosim biosimspace`
    * Also available freely online
      * https://try.openbiosim.org
    * More examples at 
      * https://biosimspace.openbiosim.org
      * https://github.com/openbiosim/BioSimSpaceTutorials
    ---
    ## Conclusion
    
    * OpenBioSim is a Community Interest Company developing
      and supporting software to glue together the tools
      needed for biomolecular design
    * Goal is to make the software robust, automatable
      and easier to deploy and use
    * Very open, welcoming community, very responsive to 
      new ideas and new code
    * Thanks for your attention :-)
